AI Nutritionist is a simple full‑stack web application that allows users to upload a food image and get an AI‑based prediction of what the food is, along with confidence information. It is designed as a clean, beginner‑friendly project that demonstrates frontend–backend integration with machine learning inference.

---

##  Objectives of the project

* Provides a modern web UI to upload food images
* Sends images to a backend API for prediction
* Displays predicted food label and confidence score
* Shows image preview before upload
* Handles loading and error states gracefully

The frontend is built using **HTML + Tailwind CSS**, while the backend exposes a `/predict` API endpoint (implemented separately, typically using **FastAPI**).

---

##  Why this project is useful

* Great learning reference for **full‑stack ML projects**
* Demonstrates **image upload handling** using `FormData`
* Shows clean **frontend–backend communication** via `fetch`
* Minimal and readable codebase, easy to extend
* Ideal starting point for projects like:

  * AI Nutrition Tracker
  * MyFitnessPal‑style apps
  * Food calorie estimation systems

---

##  Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: HTML, Tailwind CSS, Vanilla JavaScript
* **Backend**: FastAPI (hosted separately)
* **ML**: Image classification model (dummy or real, backend‑side)
* **Hosting**:

  * Frontend: Static hosting (GitHub Pages / Netlify)
  * Backend: Render

## ⚙️ How to get started

### 1️. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-nutritionist.git
cd ai-nutritionist
```

### 2️. Open the frontend

This project uses plain HTML, so you can directly open the file:

```bash
index.html
```

Or serve it using a local server (recommended):

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

### 3️. Configure backend endpoint

In `index.html`, update the API URL if needed:

```js
fetch("https://tailwind1-ikqo.onrender.com/predict", {
  method: "POST",
  body: formData
});
```

Ensure the backend `/predict` endpoint:

* Accepts multipart file uploads
* Returns JSON with:

  * `prediction`
  * `confidence`
  * `filename`
  * `size_kb`

---

##  Example API Response

```json
{
  "message": "Prediction successful",
  "prediction": "Pizza",
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "filename": "food.jpg",
  "size_kb": 245
}
```
